# Description

The model is a Transformer network based on a DistilBERT pre-trained model. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned on the SemEval 2023 Task 3 training dataset for the propaganda detection task.
Hyperparameters :

Batch size = 16; Learning rate = 2e-5; AdamW optimizer; Epochs = 4.

Accuracy = 90 % on SemEval 2023 test set.

The model is avaialable on Huggingface: https://huggingface.co/IDA-SERICS/PropagandaDetection
